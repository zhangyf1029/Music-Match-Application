# Music Match Application

## General Functions
This web application will be a social app based on music for the BU Community. We want to create a web application that gets a user's Spotify account (from Spotify API) to understand and analyze their music preferences. Users are matched with other users with a percentage of similar music preferences and will be able to see each other's top artists. Once they are matched, they will have the opportunity to connect and chat with each other using their contact info. The application would also suggest events that they might both like  based on genres of common interest and events in Boston (from TicketMaster API).

## Documents
In the dating-app file, it includes front-end and back-end codes of our application. The user stories are covered in docs file.
