PROPOSALS:
Idea 1: Dating and music preferences - spotify  
This web application will be a dating app based on music. We want to create a web application that gets a user's Spotify account to understand and analyze their music preferences. Users are matched with other users with a percentage of similar music preferences and will be able to know which song they both listen to on the same day. Once they are matched, they will have the opportunity to connect and chat with each other. The application would also suggest a first date for the match based on an API.

Idea 2: Calendar for different events 
	This web application will generate a calendar for different events based on a user's taste and preferences. Userâ€™s select events that they would like to attend and virtual Eventbrite events are suggested in a calendar. MBTA and alternative transportation options would be reported for each event.
