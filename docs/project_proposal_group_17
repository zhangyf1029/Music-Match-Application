PROPOSALS for group 17:

Idea 1: Dating and music preferences - spotify  
This web application will be a dating app based on music. We want to create a web application that gets a user's Spotify account to understand and analyze their music preferences. Users are matched with other users with a percentage of similar music preferences. Once they are matched, the application would also suggest a first date for the match based on their preferences. We expect to use a music API and event API.

Idea 2: Calendar for different events 
This web application will generate a calendar for different events based on a user's taste and preferences. Userâ€™s select events that they would like to attend and Eventbrite events are suggested in a calendar. Transportation options would be reported for each event. We expect to use an event API and a transportation API (such as the MBTA API so this application would be specic to Boston).
