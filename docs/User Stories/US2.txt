US2: User Login. The user enters an email or phone number (depending on what they created the account with). A verification code is sent to their preferred method of sign-in, and they have to enter that code in the box which will log the user in. If the email or phone number is not registered, a dialog box to create a new account will redirect them to the initial sign-up (see US1).
